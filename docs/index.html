        <li>It's a computer vision application helps in monitoring objects and ensures that each object is in its right place</li>
        <li>The user selects the objects to be watched and draw regions (draw squares with the mouse) that the object is allowed to exist in. (let's call those regions safe zones).</li>
        <li>Or the user can specify regions that the object isn't allowed to exist in(let's call them danger zones)</li>
        <li>If the objects enter its own danger zone, or leave its safe zones, the application will alert the user and may take some action</li>

          <p class="a">Incidents that may occur within the house, such as when a child climbs the edge of the bed and puts himself in a dangerous situation, or when your pet jumps on the dining table to eat your food, and many more examples.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p class="q">Why and in which way is the problem relevant (to you/the society/or a specific group)?</p>
          <p class="a">If I install a monitoring camera, I would like to automate the monitoring process. Such in case something wrong happens, it alerts me immediately.</p>

        <li>
          <p class="q">Describe a specific situation in which your application can be used</p>
          <p class="a">It may seem ironic but it's a true story (a funny personal one).
            One day, my cat got bored of its food, so he decided to make a change ...
            He thought "I will eat beef today". When no one was watching, He jumped on the dining table and ate my beef.
            And that's why I consider naming this app "Watch My Back" (I couldn't find a cool name yet).
            Let's get back in time and imagine the app existed, It would alert me once the cat entered the dining table zone, and my beef would be saved.
          </p>

        <li>
          <p class="q">Who is your target group? (Who is using your application?)</p>
          <p class="a">Anyone who has a monitoring camera.</p>
